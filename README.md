helga-readability
=================

integrates with readability

Potential ideas:

* shortens and bookmarks all links, allow for tags to be applied to certain links
* retrieve tags, such as 'last 5', which displays the last 5 links, or 'tagged 5', which displays that last 5 tagged links
* optionally produces an email summary with tagged links, daily/weekly/user preference
